      <h1>Pro Egg Tips</h1>
      <p>If there's a group of people who know how to cook eggs properly, it's pro chefs. They know the little tricks that can help you make the perfect scramble, or the softest poached egg.</p>

      <p>1. Pre-boil eggs in their shell for 10 seconds before poaching them. This will firm up the whites and keep them wrapped around the yolk.</p>

      <p>This technique will help you get that perfect oval shape and prevent the whites from going everywhere. Just gently place the whole eggs in boiling water for 10 seconds, take 'em out, and crack them into ramekins. The egg will still be completely raw, but the outer whites will have firmed up just enough to keep them together.</p>
